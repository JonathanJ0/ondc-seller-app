# ONDC Seller App PoC

This repository contains the code and documentation for a seller app Proof of Concept (PoC) developed as part of my internship at Assentcode Technologies. The app integrates with the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) platform, focusing on catalogue publishing and exploring generative AI for product descriptions.

## Project Structure
- `docs/`: Contains documentation related to the project.
  - `ONDC_Understanding_Document.md`: An overview of the ONDC platform and its relevance to the seller app.
- `client/`: (To be added) React.js frontend for the seller app.
- `server/`: (To be added) Node.js backend with PostgreSQL database integration.

## Tasks
1. **Explore ONDC Platform:** Understanding document completed (see `docs/ONDC_Understanding_Document.md`).
2. **Build Seller App PoC:** Implement a seller app with catalogue publishing using React.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.
3. **Generative AI Integration:** Explore AI for assisting sellers in publishing catalogues.

## Next Steps
- Implement the seller app PoC with ONDC integration.
- Add generative AI features for catalogue creation.
